# About
This is a repository for a GitHub Pages webpage about EDI invoices. It is primarily intended as an implementation guide for vendors.

It was developed with help from "New video: Develop GitHub Pages (Jekyll) using Docker" from BillRaymond.

# Setup
To get started, clone the repository, cd into it, and open in VS Code.

Click the button to Reopen in container (you may need Docker and the Dev Container extension). Then give the following commands:

```
bundle install
bundle update
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
```

That will let you see your webpage locally. There are more details in the BillRaymond video.
